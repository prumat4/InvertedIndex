## Inverted Index and parser
This C++ project implements an inverted index data structure for efficient set operations in collections. It includes functionalities for creating collections, inserting sets, and performing searches based on set intersections, containment, and more. The project provides a flexible interface via a parser to execute various commands and operations on collections, making it useful for indexing and querying sets efficiently.
